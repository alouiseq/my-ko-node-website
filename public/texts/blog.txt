      post: "It's been awhile since I posted as I've been quite busy. My daughter Alyssa just had her first birthday last weekend. Shout out to my baby girl!<br/><br/>For the last month, I've created another website for my family through Wordpress (<a href='http://thequiatchons.com' target='_blank' title='Family Site'>click here</a> to view)<br/><br/>I've also just completed the Django tutorial that can be found on their <a href='https://djangoproject.com' title='Django' target='_blank'>website</a>. It helped me jumpstart my transition from static to a more dynamic website. This blog you're reading now (along with all the previous blogs) is stored in a Postgre database through Django's API. I've also transferred my website to Heroku (previously hosted on <a href='https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/' target='_blank' title='Nearlyfreespeech'>nearlyfreespeech.net</a>), a PAAS technology, to develop and deploy my Python/Django web application.<br/><br/>Also, I've read up and gone through a simple tutorial on Angular.js. As I explore and look for other MV* Javascript frameworks, I'll probably do some reading on Backbone.js, Knockout.js, Ember.js and whatever else is currently available that will be more suited for a couple of applications I have in mind.<br/><br/>To stay up to date with C/C++ (due to my short term memory), I'm also doing some reading on a couple of books (listed below) whenever I can find time:<br/><br/><pre>- Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell<br/>- Programming Interviews Exposed by John Mongan, et al</pre><br/>Lastly, I'll probably create a couple of tutorial videos (or blogs) regarding static pages with Django and hosting with Heroku to hopefully save some of you time with the process so stay tuned."
